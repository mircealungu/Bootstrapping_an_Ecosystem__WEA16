\section {Reflections}

Until now, all the applications that were added, have been in one way or another supported by the creator of the ecosystem. Although all the actors could benefit from joining such an ecosystem,  the challenge of incentivizing external application developers to add support for the Zeeguu platform remains a future challenge. We will work on defining policies that will benefit all the players \cite{Jans09agenda}. 


Also, this is not the first ecosystem that aims to track 
the interactions of a user with data and build a better 
user model based on this; many commercial companies do it too. 
However, the goals of these companies are usually economic, 
while the goal of our ecosystem would be research and education. This already hints at the possibility of one type of stakeholder being researchers.

It would seem thus, that since profit is not the main
goal of such an ecosystem, we should be confronting
with different problems than those enterprises where 
profit is critical. However, the economical 
sustainability of the platform when hosted in academia
is still an open question. The hosting costs of the 
core components are at the moment not significant 
but they could become large in the eventualily of 
a massive growth.


One way to do this would be to unequivocally show 
the benefits it brings to the learners. Based on 
early user studies and the feedback we received 
from individual applications we can say that such
an ecosystem shows promise. But more work has to 
be done for this. 

% One other aspect that has not been discussed here

% private information about a reader does not leak
% between applications.

% lessons derived here hold beyond the given case study. It 
% might be and it is our hope that they can be of

% - how to insure privacy? should everything in the profile be visible for all the apps?
