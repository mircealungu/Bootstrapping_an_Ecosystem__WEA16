Learning the vocabulary of a new language is a very slow and time consuming process which can take many years of dedicated study. Free reading is known to be important for improving vocabulary and so are optimally timed repetitions of learned concepts. However, these two have not been put together until now. 

This paper presents the idea of an ecosystem of applications which by monitoring the reading activities of a learner can build a model of their evolving knowledge and steer their future reading and studying sessions in such a way as to accelerate the speed with which they acquire new vocabulary. 

The paper describes a high-level architecture of such an ecosystem together with a prototpye implementation of several of components and applications. Finally a series of hypotheses that highlight opportunities for future research are discussed.

% the underlying platform dubbed Zeeguu, and exemplify some of the lessons learned while bootstrapping the ecosystem with several applications that complement each  other but are joined in the aim of accelerating vocabulary acquisition in a second language.
