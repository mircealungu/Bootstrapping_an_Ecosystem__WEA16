Learning the vocabulary of a new language is a very slow and time consuming process which can take many years of dedicated study. 

In this paper I present the idea of an ecosystem which by monitoring the reading activities of a learner can build a model of their evolving knowledge and steer their future reading and studying sessions in such a way as to accelerate the speed with which they acquire new vocabulary. 

I describe a high-level architecture of the underlying platform dubbed Zeeguu, and exemplify some of the lessons learned while bootstrapping the ecosystem with several applications that complement each  other but are joined in the aim of accelerating vocabulary acquisition in a second language.
